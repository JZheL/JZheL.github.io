I am an undergraduate student at Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology (XDU) and will continue my master's degree at XDU in September this year. My research interest includes Deep Learning, Model Pruning, and Dataset Pruning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xie] of ISN Lab from [Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology].
